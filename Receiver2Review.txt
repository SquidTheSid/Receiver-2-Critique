Receiver 2 Critique: Misfire

Modern military shooters fetishize firearms. These games maintain a facade of
authenticity, yet their weapon mechanics are anything but realistic. That's why
I find Receiver's deconstruction of the genre to be so fascinating, as guns are
extremely dangerous to handle. Failing to perform adequate safety precautions
can and will result in negligent discharges. Of course, there's more to a
shooter than weapon handling, so let's see how Receiver 2 fares as a
complete package.

The game's introduction is rough. While the tutorial introduces you to some
essential mechanics like jumping or crouching, it fails to describe its systems
in sufficient detail. For example, you're left to figure out how player health
works, as there's no HUD element to tell you what's going on. This is fine for
enemy turrets, since it's easy to understand that a bullet will outright kill
you. However, negligent discharges and environmental damage are much more
difficult to figure out.

Let me describe these systems as as simply as I can. 1 enemy bullet will kill
you instantly regardless of its entry point. However, excluding the Desert
Eagle, you can take one negligent discharge from your own firearm before you
die. 

Environmental damage taken inflicted by flying glass shards or from falling
from heights operates off of a different ruleset. Depending on its velocity,
environmental damage will either outright kill you or make you temporarily limp
for a few seconds.  If you don't sustain another injury while limping, your
body will return to normal status, where you can then take another instance of
environmental damage. Therefore, it's possible to chain together limps
infinitely so long as they're timed properly, but it's obviously not
recommended.  

To get more information about your firearm, you need to scrounge through its
respective codex entry or squint at the contextual tooltips, but neither of
these are adequate substitutes for a proper tutorial. Maybe it's because I've
never touched a gun in real life, so concepts like racking back a pistol's
slide to inspect the chamber or manually decocking a revolver's hammer are
unfamiliar to me, but I shouldn't have to resort to looking up gun safety
videos online to figure this out. 

Let me describe how firearms control in Receiver 2, since they're much closer
to their real life counterparts than other video games. Your guns are split
into two categories: revolvers, and semi automatic pistols. 

With revolvers, you'll either have a Colt Single Action Army Peacemaker or a
Colt Double Action Detective Special. The major difference between them is that
the Detective Special's double action trigger will automatically cock the gun's
hammer when you fire the gun. With the Peacemaker, you must manually cock the
hammer each time you want to fire a shot. Reloading is also extremely different
between the two. The Detective Special is fairly straightforward, as you need
to pull out the cylinder, dump out its rounds, and manually load in bullets.
The SAA is much trickier. You need to half cock the hammer, pull out a spent
round, and replace it with a fresh bullet. If you want to reload the entire
gun, you'll need to manually spin the cylinder and repeat this process for all
six rounds. 

Although it's much more cumbersome to use, I prefer the Peacemaker for one
reason: safety. Though the double action trigger makes the Detective Special
more convenient to use, you always need to worry about negligent discharges,
from forgetting to manually uncock the hammer or forgetting to empty the
cylinder before you holster the gun. This isn't a problem for the SAA as it
will never fire unless you manually cock the hammer. Thus, I've never shot
myself in the leg with it, whereas the Detective Special has ended runs. 

Semi automatic pistols like the Colt M1911 or Beretta M9 utilize magazines
rather than cylinders. Each round must be individually loaded into said
magazines before it can be used in the gun.  Once the magazine has been
equipped, you need to manually chamber the round.  Additionally, most of these
firearms have safeties that must be toggled off to fire the gun. 

Like the Detective Special, I've got mixed feelings on this weapon category.
While semiautomatic pistols have have much larger ammo reserves and are more
convenient to use in a firefight, they require more preparation than a revolver
and are extremely prone to negligent discharges if you forget to unchamber your
rounds. Though there are many ways to safely carry around these weapons, I
found the most convenient option was to simply keep my rounds unchambered until
I found an enemy nearby. 

Overall, the guns are easily Receiver 2's greatest strength. Even though every
firearm you get is some variation of a pistol, the impressively detailed weapon
models and ballistics make them feel distinct from each other, albeit less so
with semi automatics. I like how you're forced to create mental checklists of
the steps you need to perform to maintain your gun after every encounter, lest
you end up shooting yourself in the leg. In theory, this creates some truly
hectic firefights as you need to constantly worry about your firearm's
condition while being shot at. 

However, this is where my praise of the game ends, as this exceptional firearm
system is inserted into an exceedingly mediocre game riddled with catastrophic
bugs and needless repetition.  

What really lets down the gunplay for me are the uninteresting enemies. There
are a total of two types in this game: stationary turrets and drones. While
there are some mechanical differences between turret types, such as armored or
proximity stealth variants, their overall behaviors are identical. They'll emit
out a beam of light in front of them. as they scan from location to location.
To defeat them, you'll need to place a shot in their ammo boxes to disable
their firing mechanism, shoot out their turning gyro to let you sneak behind
them, or shoot out their sight to make them effectively blind. Once you do any
of these three, you can safely hack the turret to permanently disable it. Now
repeat this process for the dozens of turrets you'll find in the game, since
you'll take down each one in the exact same way. 

Drones are a bit more interesting in that they're not immobile threats. They'll
actively move around in a fixed pattern with a wide detection radius. If you're
spotted, they will relentlessly chase after you and tase you to death. To
escape them, you'll need to juke around corners and rooms to stop them from
pursuing you any further. While these pursuits are fun and incredibly tense,
you'll probably never be on one unless you're extremely reckless, as drone
are always highly visible and can be taken out with one body shot.  

I would've liked to see an enemy type that actively kept me on my toes, one
that is constantly hunting me down and prevents me from being overly cautious
in sweeping through rooms. Because as it is, the game doesn't punish me for
keeping my gun unloaded before every firefight, since I know I'll never be
ambushed.  As a result, I rarely have to worry about negligent discharges, the
central mechanic forcing me to be slow and methodical.


For all intents and purposes, Receiver 2 has one level that you replay over and
over with some minor changes in lighting. It has procedural room arrangement to
keep things fresh, but this system has two major issues.  The chief problem is
that there simply aren't enough tilesets in the game, with there being a total
of 16 spanning all five missions. Furthermore, identical rooms are often placed
directly next to each other, heightening the deja vu.  After an hour of play, I
got sick of seeing the exact same apartment and warehouse tiles spammed over
and over and over again. Given that Receiver 2's story involves multiple
in-game realities, I don't see why the developers couldn't have distorted the
tilesets to get more effective reuse out of them. Rooms could have their
gravity inverted, forcing you to play on the ceiling. Other tilesets could've
scaled up or down in size like in Alice in Wonderland. 

Adding to sense of repetition, the objectives in each mission are exactly the
same, with you going on a blind scavenger hunt for easy-to-miss audio tapes.
It also really doesn't help that these spawn in randomly, so there's no logical
way to deduce their location and seek them out. You just have to drunkenly
stumble around in darkly lit rooms praying that you actually find one. Enemy
turrets do have a decent chance of dropping a recording upon death, but the
drop rate isn't high enough to reliably count on. As a result, depending on
RNG, you can either spend a few minutes or a whole hour in a single level.  


What drives this reptition to the point of frustration is the assbackwards
death system. When you die in Receiver 2, you become demoted, forcing you
replay the previous level before you can reattempt the current one. In theory,
this system heavily punishes you for being sloppy, forcing you to be slow and
meticulous. In reality, this just means that you end up having to repeat
several hours of progress in identical looking levels with identical looking
enemies hunting down RNG objectives because you made one fuckup. I suspect this
is an attempt to pad out the game's run time like in roguelikes, as you could
beat Receiver 2's campaign in an hour or two otherwise.  The thing is,
roguelikes generally have a lot of environmental, enemy, and item variety that
keeps new runs feeling fresh whenever you have to restart. It's also possible
to beat most of them in under half an hour if you're skilled enough.  Receiver
2 has neither of these due to its limited tilesets and RNG objectives.

To preserve your sanity, I'd just recommend save scumming throughout the
campaign, as if you quit the game before you die, you load back in a safe
position upon restarting the game. Given the exceedingly generous death window,
it's entirely possible, if not trivial to brute force the entire campaign by
save scumming.

Let's now talk about the elephant in the room: bugs. they're so egregious that
I legitimately could not beat Receiver 2 without using the debug console.
Examples include: Loaded magazines disappearing on me for no reason, leaving me
with no way to use my gun until I stumbled upon a new mag. Doing a stationary
jump or falling from any distance resulting in instant death, no matter the
height. The game resetting all of my current progress and forcing me to restart
the entire campaign. Perhaps your experience will differ than mine, but the
amount of game-breaking bugs and crashes I've encountered is shocking. 

Overall, Receiver 2 is a great experiment, and I love how it deconstucts an
otherwise stagnant genre while simultaneously promoting real life gun safety.
However, I can't say that it's a good game, given its terrible level design,
frustrating design decisions, and plethora of destructive bugs. Hopefully
Wolfire or another developer will build upon this concept and make a truly
exceptional realistic shooter with an emphasis on gun safety.

Thank you very much for watching. I want to thank Wolfire for giving me a
review key and for providing technical support. The Borderlands 3 video is
being worked on, especially now that I've finished slogging through my fourth
and final playthrough. If you thought I was hard on Receiver 2, just you wait.
After that, DOOM Eternal. It's a phenomenal game, what more can I say?  If
