Modern military shooters fetishize firearms. These games maintain a facade of
authenticity, yet their weapon mechanics are anything but realistic. That's why
I find Receiver's deconstruction of the genre to be so fascinating, as guns are
extremely dangerous to handle. Failing to perform adequate safety precautions
can and will result in negligent discharges. Of course, there's more to a
shooter than just weapon handling, so let's see how Receiver 2 succeeds as a
complete package.

The game's introduction is rough. While the tutorial introduces you to some of
the essential mechanics, it fails to describe systems in adequate detail. For
example, you're left to figure out how player health works, as there's no HUD
indicator to tell you what's going on. This is fine for enemy turrets, since
it's easy enough to understand that a bullet will kill you instantly. However,
negligent discharges and environmental damage are much more difficult to figure
out since there's no clear player feedback given.

So, let me break these systems and describe them as simply as I can. 1 enemy bullet
will kill the player regardless of entry point. However, excluding the Desert
Eagle, you can take one negligent discharge from your own firearm before you
die. 

Environmental damage from flying glass shards or falling from heights operates
off of a different ruleset. Depending on its velocity, environmental damage
will either outright kill you or make you temporarily limp for a few seconds.
If you don't sustain another injury while limping, your body will return to
normal status, where you can then take another instance of environmental
damage. Therefore, it's possible to chain together limps so long as they're
timed properly, but it's obviously not recommended.  

Similarly, guns are tricky to understand if you've never fired one in real life. I haven't, so I had to look up instructional tutorials from real life firearms instructors.
